Readel is a basic retrieval system for Readeck annotations. It will
show or insert highlights (called "annotations" in Readeck) from a
selected article (called "bookmark" in Readeck).

Readeck is a self-hosted read-it-later system. See [[https://readeck.org][readeck.org]].

Note: The code is very basic. There's no error handling involved.

To use Readel, set the following parameters:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq readel-url "https://url.to.readeck"  ;; Readeck URL
      readel-token "abc123"                ;; Readeck API token
      readel-bookmarks-label "label")      ;; Label to filter bookmarks
#+end_src

Note:
 - Set =readel-bookmarks-label= to nil to disable filtering.
 - Make sure there is no trailing =/= in the =readel-url=.

Readel will retrieve and show highlights in Org-mode formatting.

Readel provides two user-facing functions:
- =readel-annotations-insert-from-bm= to select a bookmark and display
  its annotations in a separate buffer.
- =readel-annotations-buffer-render= to insert annotations at point.
